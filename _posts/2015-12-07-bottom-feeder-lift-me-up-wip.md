# Bottom Feeder. Lift Me Up. (WIP)

This is a new piece that I am working on. It was brought out of storage last month and I began to transform it into a new painting. I really wanted to start to create a deeper scene, with more layers.

I'll start this process after about of month of work. I am starting on adding mountains in the background and detailing the catfish at the bottom. I want to bring in the scenery of the American South.

Also, one of the processes that I am bringing back in my new paintings is "throwing myself off". Doing and adding things to the piece that don't fit, that don't make sense. Why? I have to make it work. Add neon pink to the painting... make neon pink work in the painting.
