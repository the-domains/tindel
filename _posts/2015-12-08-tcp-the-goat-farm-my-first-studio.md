# TCP + The Goat Farm = My First Studio

So proud & happy to announce that I will be part of the 2015-2017 TCP Artist in Residency Studio program. I now have a studio at the Goat Farm Arts Center. So excited to be able to work with new folks and utilize a space simply for creation. Great group of artists and look forward to sharing more as this opportunity evolves.
